# Involuntary WebTorrent Test

A collection of HTML documents, JavaScript files and Mozilla Firefox extensions to test involuntary browser-based torrenting using the WebTorrent library.

**Tested using Mozilla Firefox 76.0 browser**

The collection of files were developed for a research project by a student of OS3. The goal was to determine whether involuntary browser-based peer-to-peer file sharing is possible using the WebTorrent library, which relies on JavaScript and WebRTC. These files are meant to help reproduce the experiments of the conducted research, which show that at the time of writing, 7th of October 2020, it is possible to abuse the library.

## 1 - WebTorrent Test Clients

This includes simple WebTorrent clients that were written during the experiments for research purposes. Each client is created as a single HTML document containing JavaScript code. The clients can be opened with any browser that supports JavaScript and WebRTC.

## 2 - Firefox Extensions

This includes Mozilla Firefox extensions that were created to show that it is possible to run WebTorrent in the background of a browser by adding it to a browser extension and to show a method which attempts to detect and block the usage of the WebTorrent library. The extensions can be tested without installation using the about:debugging page.

## 3 - Miscellaneous

This includes a mixture of relevant files that were generated while conducting the research.
